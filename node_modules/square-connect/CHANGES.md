# Change Log

## Version 2.7.0 (2018-04-26)

### New features: Transactions API and Payments API

The Transactions API in Connect v2 now includes payment and refund information from exchanges.

* `ListTransactions` now includes payment information from sales and exchanges and refund
information from returns and exchanges.
* `ListRefunds` now includes refunds that result from exchanges in addition to partial refunds and
itemized returns through Square's Point of Sale applications.

The Payments API in Connect v1 now includes payment and refund information from exchanges.

* `ListPayments` now includes refunds that are generated from exchanges to account for the
value of returned goods.
* `ListRefunds` now returns an approximate number of refunds (default: 100, max: 200).
The response may contain more results than the prescribed limit when refunds are made
simultaneously to multiple tenders in a payment or when refunds are generated from exchanges
to account for the value of returned goods.
* `is_exchange` is added to `V1Refund` and `V1Tender`. Refunds and tenders marked in this way
represent the value of returned goods in an exchange, rather than actual money movement.
